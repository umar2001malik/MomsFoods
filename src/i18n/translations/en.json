Back then in a place out of paradise in Bordubet, Marmaris I remember attending my dear friend Hale's detox program which had really changed so many things in my life.",

        "Although it moved away later on from being a healthy food option with such additives as refined sugar and soy and similar products in it, it has always attracted my attention since I have always been passionate about healthy, natural eating."
